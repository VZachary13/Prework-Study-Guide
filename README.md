# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Welcome to my Prework Study Guide Webpage!

This webpage was written to serve three purposes:
- To provide a globally accesible and permanent location to write and store notes. 
- To practice the techniques and skills necessary to build a website.
- To showcase mastery over the subject matter contained within the study guide.

In making this webpage I learned a lot about JavaScript and the importance of accessibilty in a website. Currently the webpage hosts very little functionality and this section will update as it is added
